# [personal_site](https://asduveneck.github.io/personal_site/)

  Personal Site built with the HTML5UP template, Hyperspace.
  Button styling for projects was modified from Malyarchuk.
  
  Github Calendar utilizes a JS library from IonicaBizau, and I modified the CSS to format the spacing.

### In the original README for the HTML5UP template:
