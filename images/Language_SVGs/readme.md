Each Icon initially came from:
https://konpa.github.io/devicon/

The following will be repeated for each SVG

```html
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!-- source: Taken from https://konpa.github.io/devicon/ -->
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">

<!-- SVG HERE -->
```

In Konpa's SVG, by default, the provided fill is always green. I will be replacing that with the colors
`#5e42a6`, `#b74e91`, or some gradient of the two to match the other colors on my site. I will occasionally need to modify the svg myself to add in proper colors, or making it multi-line so it renders properly (ex: `babel.svg` would break unless I split the path into multiple lines)
